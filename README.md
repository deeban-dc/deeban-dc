🔥Welcome to my GitHub repo!

😄I'm an ECE student trying to learn programming, so if you're here to judge my code, please be gentle.

😄I promise I'll get better with time, just like a fine wine.

😄Just a warning, my code might make you question your life choices, but hey, isn't that what learning is all about?

😄But seriously, feel free to look around, leave a comment, or even a joke. 

⚡If you're looking for perfectly optimized code, you've come to the wrong place.
