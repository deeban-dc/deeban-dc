Hi there! I'm DEEBAN CHAKRAVARTHY, and I'm excited to share my journey as I learn Java.

‚ú®Why Java?

I'm learning Java because it's a widely-used programming language with a large community and abundant resources available online. I believe Java will be a valuable tool for achieving my goals.

‚ú®What I've Learned So Far?

I've started with the basics. I'm currently exploring object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance.

‚ú®What's Next

My goal is to become proficient in Java programming and start building real-world applications. I plan to continue learning through online courses, practice exercises, and personal projects.

‚ù§Ô∏èThanks for reading, and happy coding!
